# If I DIEARY <br>

**Project Duration**: Oct 2022- Dec 2022<br><br>

## Description
If I DIEARY combines "DIE" and "DIARY," inspired by Beenzino's song "If I die tomorrow," starting with the question: "What if tonight is the last day of my life?" It serves as a diary for easily recording daily experiences and feelings, encouraging users to cherish each moment and promoting a life without regrets. <br><br><br>

## What the Application Does
- Users can write daily entries with text, emojis, and photos.
- Users can view the books they have read and places they have visited.<br><br><br>

## Unique Features
- **No Delete Function**: Encourages users to appreciate every memory and reflect on their lives by removing the option to delete entries, emphasizing the value of all experiences.<br><br><br>

## Challenges Faced
- **Data Management**: Designing a secure database for user data was a major challenge, ensuring privacy and integrity.
- **User Experience**: Creating an intuitive interface that balances functionality and ease of use required extensive testing.
- **API Integration**: Implementing external APIs, such as Google Maps and Interpark Book API, posed difficulties, particularly in ensuring smooth data retrieval and integration.<br><br><br>
